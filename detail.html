                        The most impressive should be to go to Tianxinxiang and  spent 61  with  children,
                         freshman just came to Wuhan, remember to prepare the program for the children,
                         After the rehearsal, it was still raining,
                          and my roommates and I walked on the way out of the Fourth dining hall. 
                          It seemed a long time before we transferred to the subway.The flower of the motherland,
                           sometimes a little envy children, as if every day carefree, 
                           the biggest difficulty may be do not want to do homework, 
                           no moneyBuy snacks. When I was young, I was envious of growing up.
                            I thought I could be financially independent when I grew up. T
                            here was no one to restrain me and I could do a lot of things by myself.
                            We're growing, we're losing, we're gaining, and so emMM,
                             according to the various conservation laws, is beside the point.In fact, 
                             I have always wanted a younger sister and younger brother. 
                             I think it is good to be stuck by children. They are very simple and may cry for small things,
                              but forget them, met a little boy, very lovely, that is to say, 
                              he suddenly said to me, asked me to eat , 
                              in fact, 
                              I do not like to eat candy, but I feel his face is serious,
                               as if the candy is delicious,
                                his expression is telling me delicious,Then he even rode his own bike and ran home to me, 
                                a little like running accounts, less books read, laughing and crying.Anyway, 
                                I thought I was in a good mood all day and I would appreciate the kindness from strangers
                                . Oh, I think I added that kid's QQ. Volunteer activityI think it may be mutual help, 
                                I think of an article, the author will open the door for the elderly every time what small details,
                                 he hopes his parents can also Meet such kindness.
